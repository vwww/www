My website first started out as a static Microsoft Frontpage website in late 2004. Around 2005-2006, I adapted it into PHP, rewrote a basic script, and then modified a free template. By early 2008, most of this site became static HTML and PHP generator scripts. Recently, in late 2013, it has been rewritten in Jekyll.
